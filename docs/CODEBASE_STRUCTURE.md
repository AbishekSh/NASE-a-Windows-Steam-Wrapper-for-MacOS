# SteamWineWrapper Codebase Structure

This document describes the current repository organization and the boundaries that should stay clear as the app evolves.

## Product Shape

SteamWineWrapper is currently split into two layers:

- `Sources/SteamWineApp/`: the native SwiftUI macOS product.
- `mysteamwine/` plus `mysteamwine.py`: the Python backend that manages Wine, bottles, Steam, graphics layers, scanning, and diagnostics.

The SwiftUI app is the user-facing product. The Python backend is the implementation engine. The app/backend contract is moving toward structured JSON/JSONL so the UI can react to real state instead of parsing human terminal output.

## Architectural Principles And Design Choices

The architecture is intentionally hybrid. Swift and Python are not competing implementations; each owns the work it is best suited to perform.

1. **SwiftUI owns product behavior.** Window state, navigation, sheets, user confirmation, approachable errors, and presentation belong in the native app.
2. **Python owns compatibility behavior.** Wine invocation, process inspection, prefix mutation, provider CLIs, downloads, file-format parsing, repair, and diagnostics remain independently testable backend operations.
3. **The bridge is a typed boundary.** Swift creates a `BackendAction`; only `BackendBridge.swift` converts that action into command arguments. Python responds with JSON or streamed JSONL records rather than UI-oriented prose.
4. **Profiles are complete launch environments.** A renderer selection binds a tested Wine engine, graphics stack, environment, fingerprint, and bottle. It is not treated as a loose DLL toggle.
5. **Large immutable game files may be shared; mutable runtime state is isolated.** Prefixes, registries, Steam configuration, renderer DLLs, caches, logs, and tokens must not leak between profiles.
6. **Store-specific behavior stops at the provider boundary.** Epic, GOG, Steam, native apps, and personal executables are normalized into the same library-facing concepts before reaching the grid.
7. **Operations must be observable and recoverable.** Long work is represented as durable jobs with progress, cancellation, final results, and repair/rollback state.
8. **Downloaded runtimes are reproducible.** Runtime Center entries pin an exact version and checksum. Readiness requires verification of the installed layout, not merely the presence of a downloaded file.

The resulting dependency direction is:

```text
SwiftUI views
    ↓ user intent
AppViewModel / coordinators
    ↓ BackendAction
BackendBridge (JSON/JSONL process boundary)
    ↓
Python CLI command handlers
    ↓
domain modules: sources, profiles, bottles, Steam, graphics, jobs
    ↓
Wine runtimes, provider clients, files, processes, and network services
```

Lower layers do not import or manipulate SwiftUI state. Provider adapters do not decide how cards should look. Views do not construct Wine commands.

## Top-Level Files

- `Package.swift`: Swift Package manifest for the macOS app target.
- `README.md`: user-facing setup and command overview.
- `AGENTS.md`: project intent, architecture direction, and operating constraints for AI-assisted development.
- `assets/`: source app icons and logo assets.
- `Sources/SteamWineApp/Resources/`: app-bundled image resources.
- `mysteamwine.py`: thin Python entrypoint that calls `mysteamwine.cli.main()`.

## SwiftUI App

The SwiftUI layer owns library UX, app state, settings, sheets, and backend command orchestration. It should not grow Wine-specific process logic directly; that belongs in Python unless there is a clear reason to move it.

### Entry And Shell

- `SteamWineApp.swift`: app entrypoint.
- `ContentView.swift`: main window layout, sidebar, toolbar, library surface, and high-level sheet presentation.
- `SharedViews.swift`: small reusable SwiftUI pieces.
- `LibraryComponents.swift`: reusable library grid/list/detail components.

### State And Domain Models

- `Models.swift`: shared Swift enums and value types:
  - runners and sources: `RunnerKind`, `LibrarySourceFilter`
  - graphics selection: `GraphicsBackendOption`
  - library metadata: `LibraryGame`, `GameCollection`
  - backend result summaries: `BackendJob`, `BackendStructuredResult`, `BackendStreamUpdate`
  - launch status and health state
- `AppViewModel.swift`: primary observable state container. It owns:
  - selected source/game/search/filter/sort state
  - native, Steam, Wine, and pinned library arrays
  - per-game settings and launch status
  - backend job tracking and structured result history
  - settings validation and persistence
  - library import, refresh, launch, debug launch, log viewing, and health refresh orchestration

`AppViewModel.swift` is currently the largest file and is the main pressure point. Future work should move cohesive domains out only when the new file has a clear boundary, for example:

- `LibraryStore`: load/persist/import library items and pin/order state.
- `LaunchCoordinator`: Steam/Wine/macOS launch decisions and launch status.
- `HealthCoordinator`: background doctor checks and source health.
- `RuntimeStore`: Wine runtime detection/import/persistence.

Do not split it just for file size; split when it lowers coupling.

### Backend Bridge

- `BackendBridge.swift`: the Swift/Python boundary.
  - `BackendContext` stores paths and target selection.
  - `BackendAction` enumerates commands the UI can ask Python to run.
  - `BackendBridge.arguments(...)` maps Swift actions to `mysteamwine.py` CLI arguments.
  - `executeStreaming(...)` runs Python via `/usr/bin/env`, consumes JSONL, and emits `BackendStreamUpdate` values.

The bridge should remain the only place that knows the exact CLI argument shape. UI files should ask for actions, not assemble command arrays.

### Sheets

- `SettingsSheet.swift`: backend paths, bottle/prefix selection, Runtime Center, runtime status, job history, doctor/setup summaries.
- `SetupWizardSheet.swift`: guided first-run setup.
- `UpdateService.swift`: signed update-manifest verification, version checks,
  streamed DMG download, checksum validation, and user-confirmed installation.
- `WinetricksSheet.swift`: Winetricks UI.
- `GameSheets.swift`: game details, settings, logs, metadata, and per-game controls.

## Python Backend

The backend is a CLI-first engine. It should remain usable from Terminal while also supporting structured output for the SwiftUI app.

### CLI And Contract

- `mysteamwine/cli.py`: command parser and command handlers.
  - Global target selection: `--bottle` or `--prefix`.
  - Global runtime selection: `--wine` / related Wine path flags.
  - Structured modes: `--json` and `--jsonl`.
  - Job events: start, step, progress, result.
  - Commands include setup, doctor, Steam launch, game launch, direct debug launch, Winetricks, graphics installers, scanning, and advice.

The CLI is the compatibility contract. Existing commands should keep working even when the app gains richer structured behavior.

### Runtime And Bottles

- `runtime.py`: executable resolution, Wine runtime detection, process execution, detached process spawning, downloads, and sanitized Metal-related environment handling.
- `steam_libraries.py`: read-only cross-bottle Steam library discovery, profile-independent AppID resolution, and the canonical atomic `steam-libraries.json` registry.
- `steam_identity.py`: a locked shared-auth boundary that extracts and merges only Steam login metadata and bounded account-auth subtrees. It refuses mutation while any managed Windows Steam process is running and never shares entire prefixes or configuration files.
- `sources/base.py`: source-neutral status and game records used by future store adapters.
- `sources/epic.py`: Legendary-backed Epic status, authentication, and library discovery. It forces Windows catalog resolution on macOS, stores provider state beneath NASE app support, locks API operations to prevent refresh-token races, and never exposes authorization codes in structured results.
  - The managed Legendary wheel is checksum-pinned in `catalog.py` and installed into a native Python 3.10–3.13 virtual environment; the incompatible legacy x86 standalone is not selected.
  - Epic installs use a shared host directory; update, verify, repair, and uninstall remain provider jobs.
  - Launch delegates Epic online-auth parameter generation to Legendary while NASE supplies the selected Wine prefix and complete graphics-profile environment.
- `sources/gog.py`: GOG account, library, install registry, and `gogdl` adapter.
  - Authentication tokens live under `sources/gog/auth.json` with owner-only permissions; prefixes are never shared.
  - Owned games and official artwork come from GOG Galaxy/GamesDB metadata, while the checksum-pinned architecture-specific `gogdl` client handles Windows downloads, updates, repair, and launch task resolution.
  - Installed game files live in a shared GOG host library and launch through the selected isolated NASE compatibility-profile bottle.
  - Galaxy may return hidden, retailer-specific, or duplicate release entitlements. The adapter accepts only visible `game`/`mod` records, groups releases by canonical GOG `game_id`, and prefers the installed or artwork-complete release. The UI therefore receives one card per canonical game.
- `library_activity.py`: locked persistent ownership for shared libraries. It permits one Windows Steam owner per library, supports multiple games under that owner, and replaces stale ownership only after the previous Steam process exits.
- `catalog.py`: managed runtime catalog for Wine, DXVK, and DXMT. It owns pinned download URLs/checksums, archive extraction, install records, and one-button install helpers that can apply graphics payloads to the selected bottle.
- `bottle.py`: managed and external-prefix path model.
  - Managed bottles live under `~/Library/Application Support/MySteamWine/bottles/<name>/`.
  - External prefixes get app-managed logs/download/cache folders under `external-prefixes/<hash>/` while preserving the external prefix path itself.

### Steam And Launching

- `steam.py`: Steam installer/runner, Wine launch environment, game launch helpers, direct executable launch, VDF parsing, `libraryfolders.vdf` discovery, and `appmanifest_*.acf` game listing.
  - `run_steam(...)` launches Windows Steam in the bottle.
  - `launch_app(...)` launches through Steam with `-applaunch`.
  - `run_game_executable(...)` launches a chosen `.exe` directly with Wine.
  - `list_installed_apps(...)` detects installed Steam games from manifests.

Current Steam launch modes are:

- `run-steam`: open Windows Steam with plain Wine by default.
- `launch-game`: launch a Steam AppID through Windows Steam.
- `smart-launch-game`: try direct executable launch first, then fall back to Steam.
- `debug-game`: direct executable launch with richer debug logging and overrides.

### Graphics Installers

- `dxmt.py`: DXMT install and registry override management.
- `dxvk.py`: DXVK install from upstream or DXVK-macOS layouts.
- `gptk.py`: bounded compatible-runtime discovery, explicit Wine/D3DMetal version pairing, and confirmed import into persistent NASE-managed runtime storage without flattening the renderer bundle.
- `d3dmetal.py`: complete D3DMetal bundle inspection, mutually exclusive overrides, per-launch native search-path injection, and post-install profile verification.
- `pe.py`: lightweight PE machine detection used to distinguish 32-bit x86 applications from 64-bit executables before launch.
- `legacy_directx.py`: validates user-provided dgVoodoo2 x86 payloads and builds removable per-game overlays without writing wrapper DLLs into shared Steam installations.

Graphics-specific modules own file-layout validation and registry override edits. D3DMetal keeps its `wine`, `external`, and framework directories intact; launch modules obtain the complete environment from `d3dmetal.py` and inject it for every Steam and direct-game process.

Treat each graphics choice as a runtime profile, not only a DLL selection. DXMT uses the validated Wine Stable context. D3DMetal pins checksum-verified Sikarugir Wine 10 revision 6 to a complete renderer bundle plus an isolated `-D3DMetal` bottle. DXVK requires a separately validated Wine Vulkan/MoltenVK host stack. These renderer modes are mutually exclusive, and a successful DLL copy alone does not prove that the host graphics runtime can launch a game.

### Health, Dependencies, And Advice

- `doctor.py`: environment and prefix checks plus safe repairs.
- `jobs.py`: atomic durable job records, interrupted-job reconciliation, and
  verified backend-process cancellation.

### Packaged application layout

`scripts/build-app.sh` turns the SwiftPM executable into `NASE.app`. The release
bundle embeds the Python backend and probe tools at
`Contents/Resources/Backend`; `BackendContext.default()` prefers that location
and falls back to the repository only for development builds.

Signing/notarization assets live under `release/`, release automation under
`scripts/`, and the complete credential, update-feed, and clean-machine process
is documented in `docs/RELEASING.md`.
- `sessions.py`: persistent launch-session registry, real process reconciliation, targeted per-game termination, and ownership-aware Steam cleanup. Session records already carry a compatibility-profile id so runtime fingerprints can be added without replacing the lifecycle contract.
- `profiles.py`: compatibility-profile definitions and immutable per-bottle runtime/source fingerprints. A profile binds Wine, the graphics stack, and a dedicated bottle as one launch unit.
  - `setup-compatibility-profile` performs the observable setup workflow and only marks the profile manifest ready after Wine, Steam, and renderer setup succeed.
- `dependencies.py`: read-only host readiness checks for macOS, Python, Rosetta, Winetricks, Wine Stable 11, managed DXMT 0.71, and optional GPTK components.
  - Confirmed installation commands are generated as argument arrays without a shell. Rosetta license acceptance is mandatory, Homebrew installs Python/Wine Stable/Winetricks, and DXMT remains handled by the verified runtime catalog. A successful Python repair adopts and persists Homebrew's `python3` path before readiness is checked again.
  - `AppViewModel.startRecommendedBootstrap` is the guided state machine: check, confirm, install missing requirements, adopt paths, verify again, set up the DXMT profile, and open Steam. Retry starts from a fresh readiness scan, so successful work is not repeated.
- `winetricks.py`: Winetricks invocation.
- `scanner.py`: local game folder signal detection.
- `advisor.py`: rule-based dependency recommendations from scanner signals.

### Secondary UI

- `webui.py`: simple local browser frontend. This predates the richer SwiftUI product but remains useful for quick manual operation and backend debugging.
- `gui.py`: thin GUI/browser launcher glue.

## Multi-Store Source Architecture

`sources/base.py` defines the narrow normalized contract shared by store adapters:

- `SourceStatus`: client availability, authentication state, version, and a friendly message.
- `SourceGame`: stable source/store/library identifiers, title, install state/path, version/update state, and artwork URL.
- `GameSource`: status, library refresh, authentication, and sign-out behavior.

The normalized model deliberately does not contain Legendary, Galaxy, GOG certificate, Steam VDF, or Wine-specific fields. Provider-only details remain inside their adapter. This keeps `LibraryGame` and the game-card UI source-neutral.

The store workflow is:

```text
Provider account/API
    ↓ provider-specific records
EpicSource / GOGSource
    ↓ validate, filter, deduplicate, normalize
SourceGame JSON
    ↓ BackendBridge
LibraryGame
    ↓
one searchable card with shared settings and launch state
```

### Provider storage and trust boundaries

- Epic credentials and Legendary configuration live under `sources/epic/`.
- GOG tokens and the NASE-owned install registry live under `sources/gog/`.
- Authentication directories use `0700`; sensitive files use `0600`.
- Provider locks serialize token refreshes and metadata mutations.
- Tokens, authorization responses, and certificates are never returned in structured status or library results.
- Game files are installed under `game-libraries/<source>/`, outside compatibility bottles.
- At launch, the provider resolves the game task while NASE supplies the selected Wine executable, isolated prefix, and complete renderer environment.

This separation allows the same installed game to move between compatibility profiles without redownloading it or sharing the profiles themselves.

## Why JSON/JSONL Instead Of An AST

An **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** is a tree representation of source code after parsing. For example, the expression `total + tax * 2` becomes nodes such as “addition,” “name,” “multiplication,” and “number,” preserving program meaning rather than formatting. Compilers, formatters, linters, refactoring tools, and code generators use ASTs to inspect or transform code safely.

NASE's Swift/Python boundary exchanges commands, state, progress events, and results—not programming-language syntax. An AST would add a compiler-like intermediate model without solving job progress, schema validation, cancellation, versioning, or process isolation. The existing typed `BackendAction` plus versionable JSON/JSONL records is the correct abstraction.

ASTs may still be useful in narrow development tooling:

- a SwiftSyntax rule that verifies every `BackendAction` has argument, display-name, and success-message handling;
- a Python `ast` check that rejects unsafe shell construction or enforces command-handler conventions;
- automated refactoring of the large `AppViewModel.swift` when coordinators are extracted.

These should be optional lint/test tools. They should not become a runtime dependency, a new service, or the app/backend protocol. Before adding AST tooling, the higher-value contract improvement is a small explicit JSON schema version plus decoding/contract tests shared by both sides.

## Decision Summary

| Concern | Current decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User interface | Native SwiftUI | Native macOS behavior and approachable workflows |
| Compatibility engine | Python modules | Faster iteration and direct testability for Wine/provider automation |
| Cross-language contract | Typed actions plus JSON/JSONL | Observable, debuggable, versionable process boundary |
| Graphics selection | Dedicated compatibility profiles | Prevents incompatible Wine/renderer combinations and state leakage |
| Store integration | Provider adapters normalized to `SourceGame` | Keeps store details out of the library UI |
| Game storage | Shared per-source host libraries | Avoids downloading large game files once per profile |
| Mutable runtime state | Isolated bottles and provider state | Avoids registry, cache, config, token, and process conflicts |
| Long-running work | Durable structured jobs | Supports progress, restart recovery, repair, rollback, and cancellation |
| Runtime distribution | Version and checksum pinned | Makes setup reproducible and verifiable |
| AST tooling | Optional development linting only | The runtime boundary transports data, not source-code syntax |

## Current Data Flow

### Steam Library Discovery

1. `list-games` enumerates all managed bottles and includes the currently selected external prefix.
2. Each bottle's primary `steamapps` directory and `libraryfolders.vdf` references are normalized to host paths.
3. Physical libraries are deduplicated by resolved path and assigned a stable hashed ID.
4. `appmanifest_*.acf` records are validated against `steamapps/common`; stale and duplicate locations remain diagnostic registry entries.
5. The registry is atomically replaced at `~/Library/Application Support/MySteamWine/steam-libraries.json`.
6. SwiftUI receives one preferred installed location per AppID. This phase never edits Steam configuration.

### Steam Library Attachment

1. A ready managed profile requests one or more stable library IDs, or all canonical libraries.
2. The backend refuses external targets, missing Steam installations, and profile bottles whose Steam process is running.
3. A per-bottle file lock serializes attachment jobs.
4. Existing VDF entries are preserved; new host libraries are added as Wine `Z:` paths without copying game content.
5. The original `libraryfolders.vdf` receives a timestamped backup, the replacement is atomic, and parsed host paths are verified after writing.
6. Only the target profile's Steam configuration changes. Its prefix, graphics payload, shader cache, and logs remain independent from every other profile.

### Setup Flow

1. SwiftUI calls `BackendBridge.executeStreaming(.setupMetal, context: ...)`.
2. The bridge runs `python3 mysteamwine.py ... --jsonl setup-metal --dxmt-source ... --no-wait`.

### Jobs, rollback, and repair

- JSONL remains the live event transport, while `jobs.py` persists long-running
  operations independently of the SwiftUI process.
- Read-only refresh commands remain transient and do not fill job history.
- Profile setup records step progress and treats the bottle as a transaction.
  Newly created incomplete bottles are rolled back; existing bottles are kept
  and marked `needs-repair`.
- `repair-compatibility-profile` resumes the pinned setup, reruns verification,
  and only marks the manifest ready after all required probes pass.
- SwiftUI reloads durable jobs on startup and exposes cancellation and repair
  without requiring users to inspect terminal output.
3. `cli.py` emits JSONL job/step/result events.
4. Python creates or reuses the bottle, runs Wine setup, installs Steam via Winetricks, installs DXMT, and opens Steam.
5. SwiftUI merges structured steps into the setup result and updates active/recent jobs.

### Steam Library Refresh

1. SwiftUI calls `.listGames`.
2. Python reads Steam `libraryfolders.vdf` and `appmanifest_*.acf` files under the selected prefix.
3. Python returns `data.games`.
4. Swift maps those games into `LibraryGame` values and enriches them with local Steam metadata when available.

### Launch Flow

1. SwiftUI chooses macOS, Wine, or Steam launch behavior based on `LibraryGame.runner`.
2. Steam games use per-game settings to choose either:
   - `smart-launch-game` for direct executable launch attempts, or
   - `launch-game` through Windows Steam.
3. Wine games use `debug-game --exe`.
4. Python writes logs to the selected bottle/external-prefix log folder.
5. SwiftUI shows bounded log tails in the log viewer.

## Organization Assessment

The current structure is healthy enough for the next feature phase:

- Python backend responsibilities are separated by domain.
- Swift/Python communication is centralized in `BackendBridge`.
- Managed bottle and external-prefix paths have a single source of truth in Python and a matching path model in Swift.
- Structured JSON/JSONL already exists and should be extended instead of replaced.

The largest organization risk is `AppViewModel.swift`; it currently mixes library persistence, backend orchestration, runtime detection, launch policy, health checks, and log viewing. That is acceptable for early iteration, but any hidden-Steam work should avoid adding large protocol/auth/shim state there.

## Where Hidden Windows Steam Fits

The cleaner Steam experience should be introduced as backend capabilities with small Swift controls:

1. Add a `SteamLaunchMode` setting in Swift:
   - `throughSteam`
   - `directIfSafe`
   - later: `steamShimExperimental`
2. Keep direct executable detection and launch in Python.
3. Add any Steam protocol/depot/cloud helper as a separate backend module or helper process, not inside SwiftUI.
4. Keep the first version conservative:
   - direct launch installed games
   - fallback to Windows Steam
   - clear UI status when a game appears to require Steam
5. Treat Steam API shim work as a later experimental backend subsystem with explicit docs, restore paths, and per-game opt-in.

Recommended future Python modules if this grows:

- `steam_metadata.py`: appinfo, launch config, manifest/depot metadata.
- `steam_direct.py`: direct launch eligibility and executable selection.
- `steam_protocol.py`: Steam login/session/depot helper integration.
- `steam_cloud.py`: cloud save pull/push lifecycle.
- `steam_shim.py`: Steam API shim preparation, config generation, backup/restore.

## Development Rules Of Thumb

- Keep `mysteamwine.py` terminal workflows working.
- Prefer adding structured JSON fields over parsing new human text in Swift.
- Keep Wine process execution in `runtime.py`.
- Keep per-graphics file and override logic in the graphics modules.
- Keep launch policy explicit: direct launch, Steam launch, and future shim launch should be distinct modes.
- Add safety rails before mutating installed game folders, especially for any future Steam API DLL replacement or shim experiment.
